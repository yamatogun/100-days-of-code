# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, December 6th

**Today's Progress**: Quite a lot of documentation to figure out the correct database structure for my todo list app.
- Entity-Relationship
- SQLAlchemy

**Thoughts:** I am aware that building a solid background on database is key for any back-end dev so I am investing a lot of time into it. Honestly I would like to make progress into the code but I have to be patient I guess. It will come soon enough, and managing to make steady effort over several consecutive day is important skill to get when you want to learn deeper. But the frustration is real, believe me :)
