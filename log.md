# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, December 6th 2017

**Today's Progress**: Quite a lot of documentation to figure out the correct database structure for my todo list app.
- Entity-Relationship
- SQLAlchemy

**Thoughts:** I am aware that building a solid background on database is key for any back-end dev so I am investing a lot of time into it. Honestly I would like to make progress into the code but I have to be patient I guess. It will come soon enough, and managing to make steady effort over several consecutive day is important skill to get when you want to learn deeper. But the frustration is real, believe me :)

### Day 2: Thurday, December 7th 2017

**Today's Progress**: mainly documentation about how to draw entity-relationship diagram, and I also recoded a useful example from w3c website about how to filter a list of names according to a search pattern. 

**Thoughts:** Well I really wanted to recode the example because anyway i am more than likely to use this kind of client-side js code again. I know I have to focus on the todo app list, but with all this documentation, I felt as if I wasn't making progress towards my eventual goal which is knowing how to build things by myself. I feel quite relieved because I managed to recode the example, and I am pretty sure I was right to invest this time in the exercise, at least to build a sort of momentum.

### Day 3: Friday, December 8th 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still lot of readings, mainly about how to design databases with E-R diagrams. I am also currently brushing up on the main CSS properties.

**Thoughts:** Hopefully I can finish these readings soon and start applying to my projects. And I am thinking all the other steps I will have to go through after setting up the database of the todo app... And tbh I feel quite overwhelming. I feel quite bad to take that much time to finish the app, but I guess this is what happens when you are quite new to database designing and elementary front-end :) I have to be strong not to think about all the things I don't know all day long...

### Day 4: Saturday, December 9th 2017

**Today's progress**: i haven't worked as much as I wanted, so I focused my efforts on making progress on the todo app list, i.e. on trying to finish the documentation step on E-R diagrams.

**Thoughts:**: not quite satisfied, I wanted to finish the documentation about E-R modeling today. I will try to do better tomorrow. 

### Day 5: Sunday, December 10th 2017

**Today's progress**: I have finished to read the doc about E-R data modeling, read it once again to seize the global picture, and I immediatly applied this to determine the structure of the todo list app database (and especially understand why). 

**Thoughts**: feel relieved after finishing the doc, but i know it's better not to be too satisfied about finishing an subgoal, but enjoying the process instead.


### Day 6: Monday, December 11th 2017

**today's progress**: doc about how to use relationship with SQLAlchemy + finished the CSS brush up

**thoughts**: I didn't think too much about the end goal. I was focused on understanding what I was learning, which is important.

### Day 7: Tuesday, December 12th 2017

**today's progress**: 
implemented the Todo class and checked that the relationship with User was working as expected.  
did one exercise which was about inverting a linked list

**thoughts** I was glad to be able to manage to code again. I am still sick, so my pace has slowed down a bit for the past 3-4 days, but I am trying to keep going nevertheless.


### Day 8: Wednesday, December 13th 2017

**today's progress**:
- implement simple layout for the todo list app

**thoughts**
- sometimes when i see what accomplished dev do daily, i feel like i will never be good enough. I guess I just have to try my best every day and trust time ...

### Day 9: Thursday, December 14th 2017

**today's progress**
- finished layout for the login page  
- did an exercise about how to reduce space taken up by urls when crawling
- beginning of an exercise which is an application of the binary search algo

**thoughts**
I don't know whether or not I will be ready for interviews soon enought, feels like my stamina is going away these days. I have to refine my mindset so that I can trust it better and it becomes more reliable. 

### Day 10: Friday, December 15th 

**today's progress**:
- finished exercise about binary search (implementation)
- tried to figure out how to go from login page to main page (how to know which user is using the application in order to retrieve the proper todos)

**thoughts**
I need to get up earlier, and spend more time coding. Life hygiene!

### Day 11: Saturday, December 16th

**today's progress**
- layout for the todo list page
- spent some time configuring my text editor (js, css, html linters combined with vim syntastic)
- started to read documentation about Ajax so that I can perform updates and insertions of todos

**thoughts**
- an overall good day, I am quite proud of myself, especially for having managed to be organized

### Day 11: Saturday, December 16th

**today's progress**
- doc about Ajax

**thoughts**
not much to say for today, except the fact that documentation always takes more time than one can expect

### Day 12: Sunday, December 17th

**today's progress**
- most of the time spent on code dedicated to doc about ajax

### Day 13: Monday, December 18th

**today's progress**
- doc about Ajax

**thoughts**
I had to prepare for an interview. So I barely spent time on making progress in my project or anything related to it. But still, I managed to read the doc further. This will be to be expected when I have a job (hopefully), having little time for side project, so I have to get used to it.

### Day 14: Tuesday, December 19th

**today's progress**
- don't remember ...

**thoughts**
I may have inverted two days ... The interview was on Tuesday afternoon ...

### Day 15: Wednesday, December 20th

**today's progress**
- added an input html element so that we can add new tasks to do 
- tried to align it with the other elements
- added a small button and replace the icon with an svg image

**thoughts**
At last I can make progress in my todo list app again. CSS may look simple at first sight, but I feel like I am doing it the wrong way, like I am suspecting using antipatterns ... And there are many things I can't explain right now, like the behaviour of height and weight when using a border (the element seems to exceed the bounds I explicitly specified). That won't make me up with front-end dev ...

### Day 16: Thursday, December 21st

**today's progress**
- Done 3 exercises of Python Exercism's series + commented the code of other people

### Day 17: Friday, December 22sn

**today's progress**
2 Interview Cake exercises

**thoughts**
would have liked to work on the todo app


### Day 18: Saturday, December 23rd

**today's progress**
- read a short tuto about how to use Ajax in Flask app
- started code for inserting a new task in my todo list app
- tried (not solved yet) to figure out how to use external js files in my html templates (error is 404)

**thoughts**
I am quite frustrated because I was stuck almost all day, I feel tired ... as if I would never reach the end of the app development

### Day 19: Sunday, December 24th

**today's progress**
- managed to understand how to use external js file: must move it in /static directory
- another bug though: "bad request" error on the ajax request

**thoughts**
web dev errors are sometimes quite vague which makes them difficult to debut. I guess experience matters a lot.

### Day 20: Monday, December 25th

**today's progress**
- coding interview training: how to get the highest product of 3 integers

**thoughts**
not much time to practice due to the christmas eve, and my routine is disturbed

### Day 21: Tuesday, December 26th

**today's progress**
almost nothing except some newsread

**thoughts**
i need to be more thorough and meticulous, i am losing my productivity these days

### Day 22: Wednesday, December 27th

**today's progress**
- exercise on Exercism: pangram
- documentation about unit testing: unittest, fixtures, mock module

**thoughts**
not my most productive day. Would have liked to work on the app.

### Day 23: Thursday, December 27th


**today's progress**
- coding exercise: merging ranges
- doc about mock

**thoughts**
i spent too much time on activities that are not important ...
But i feel like I am getting better at handling tasks that take several days to be carried out, I can split and sustain my effort on several days if needed

### Day 24: Friday, December 28th

**progress**
- doc about mock
- read about dynamic programming
- exercism: translate dna into rna

### Day 25: Saturday, December 30th

**progress**
- Finished doc about mock
- doc on dynamic programming

**thoughts**
I find it difficult to balance training between pure algo/python exercises and building app which is more focused on developing the portfolio. Feels like doing both is necessary. At the moment, I don't manage to find time for the app.
