# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, December 6th

**Today's Progress**: Quite a lot of documentation to figure out the correct database structure for my todo list app.
- Entity-Relationship
- SQLAlchemy

**Thoughts:** I am aware that building a solid background on database is key for any back-end dev so I am investing a lot of time into it. Honestly I would like to make progress into the code but I have to be patient I guess. It will come soon enough, and managing to make steady effort over several consecutive day is important skill to get when you want to learn deeper. But the frustration is real, believe me :)

### Day 2: Thurday, December 7th

**Today's Progress**: mainly documentation about how to draw entity-relationship diagram, and I also recoded a useful example from w3c website about how to filter a list of names according to a search pattern. 

**Thoughts:** Well I really wanted to recode the example because anyway i am more than likely to use this kind of client-side js code again. I know I have to focus on the todo app list, but with all this documentation, I felt as if I wasn't making progress towards my eventual goal which is knowing how to build things by myself. I feel quite relieved because I managed to recode the example, and I am pretty sure I was right to invest this time in the exercise, at least to build a sort of momentum.

### Day 3: Friday, December 8th

**Today's Progress**: Still lot of readings, mainly about how to design databases with E-R diagrams. I am also currently brushing up on the main CSS properties.

**Thoughts:** Hopefully I can finish these readings soon and start applying to my projects. And I am thinking all the other steps I will have to go through after setting up the database of the todo app... And tbh I feel quite overwhelming. I feel quite bad to take that much time to finish the app, but I guess this is what happens when you are quite new to database designing and elementary front-end :) I have to be strong not to think about all the things I don't know all day long...
